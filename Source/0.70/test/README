Test files contain ClamAV-Test-Signature.
You need unrar 3.0 to test rarfail.rar. Only clamscan is able to scan this
file (clamd only depends libclamav, which has no support for the new RAR
format). Please use clamscan --unrar, and it will automatically switch to the
unrar utility after an internal (libclamav's) RAR error.
