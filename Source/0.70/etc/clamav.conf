# Comment or remove the line below.
Example

# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running the daemon.
# Full path is required.
#LogFile /tmp/clamd.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamd multiple times (if want to run another clamd, please
# copy the configuration file, change the LogFile variable, and run
# the daemon with --config-file option). That's why you shouldn't uncomment
# this option.
#LogFileUnlock

# Maximal size of the log file. Default is 1 Mb.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers.
#LogFileMaxSize 2M

# Log time with an each message.
#LogTime

# Log also clean files. May be useful in debugging but will drastically
# increase the log size.
#LogClean

# Use system logger (can work together with LogFile).
#LogSyslog

# Enable verbose logging.
#LogVerbose

# This option allows you to save the process identifier of the listening
# daemon (main thread).
#PidFile /var/run/clamd.pid

# Optional path to the global temporary directory.
# Default is system specific - usually /var/tmp or /tmp.
#TemporaryDirectory /var/tmp

# Path to the database directory.
# Default is the hardcoded directory (mostly /usr/local/share/clamav,
# but it depends on installation options).
#DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav

# The daemon works in local or network mode. Currently the local mode is
# recommended for security reasons.

# Path to the local socket. The daemon doesn't change the mode of the
# created file (portability reasons). You may want to create it in a directory
# which is only accessible for a user running daemon.
LocalSocket /tmp/clamd

# Remove stale socket after unclean shutdown.
#FixStaleSocket

# TCP port address.
#TCPSocket 3310

# TCP address.
# By default we bind to INADDR_ANY, probably not wise.
# Enable the following to provide some degree of protection
# from the outside world.
#TCPAddr 127.0.0.1

# Maximum length the queue of pending connections may grow to.
# Default is 15.
#MaxConnectionQueueLength 30

# When activated, input stream (see STREAM command) will be saved to disk before
# scanning - this allows scanning within archives.
#StreamSaveToDisk

# Close the connection if this limit is exceeded.
#StreamMaxLength 10M

# Maximal number of a threads running at the same time.
# Default is 5, and it should be sufficient for a typical workstation.
# You may need to increase threads number for a server machine.
#MaxThreads 10

# Waiting for data from a client socket will timeout after this time (seconds).
# Default is 120. Value of 0 disables the timeout.
#ReadTimeout 300

# Maximal depth the directories are scanned at.
MaxDirectoryRecursion 15

# Follow a directory symlinks.
# SECURITY HINT: You should have enabled directory recursion limit to
# avoid potential problems.
#FollowDirectorySymlinks

# Follow regular file symlinks.
#FollowFileSymlinks

# Do internal checks (eg. check the integrity of the database structures)
# By default clamd checks itself every 3600 seconds (1 hour).
#SelfCheck 600

# Execute a command when a virus is found. In the command string %v will
# be replaced by the virus name.
#
#VirusEvent /usr/local/bin/send_sms 123456789 "VIRUS ALERT: %v"

# Run as selected user (clamd must be started by root).
# By default it doesn't drop privileges.
#User clamav

# Initialize the supplementary group access (for all groups in /etc/group
# user is added in. clamd must be started by root).
#AllowSupplementaryGroups

# Don't fork into background. Useful in debugging.
#Foreground

# Enable debug messages in libclamav.

## Document scanning
##

# This option enables scanning of Microsoft Office document macros.
ScanOLE2

##
## Mail support
##

# Uncomment this option if you are planning to scan mail files.
#ScanMail

##
## Archive support
##


# Comment this line to disable scanning of the archives.
ScanArchive


# By default the built-in RAR unpacker is disabled by default because the code
# terribly leaks, however it's probably a good idea to enable it.
#ScanRAR


# Options below protect your system against Denial of Service attacks
# with archive bombs.

# Files in archives larger than this limit won't be scanned.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# WARNING: Due to the unrarlib implementation, whole files (one by one) in RAR
#	   archives are decompressed to the memory. That's why never disable
#	   this limit (but you may increase it of course!)
ArchiveMaxFileSize 10M

# Archives are scanned recursively - e.g. if Zip archive contains RAR file,
# the RAR file will be decompressed, too (but only if recursion limit is set
# at least to 1). With this option you may set the recursion level.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
ArchiveMaxRecursion 5

# Number of files to be scanned within archive.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
ArchiveMaxFiles 1000

# Mark potential archive bombs as viruses (0 disables the limit)
ArchiveMaxCompressionRatio 200

# Use slower decompression algorithm which uses less memory. This option 
# affects bzip2 decompressor only.
#ArchiveLimitMemoryUsage

# Mark encrypted archives as viruses (Encrypted.Zip, Encrypted.RAR).
#ArchiveBlockEncrypted

## Clamuko settings
## WARNING: This is experimental software. It is very likely it will hang

# Set access mask for Clamuko.

#ClamukoIncludePath /students

# Set the exclude paths. All subdirectories are also excluded.
#ClamukoExcludePath /home/guru

# Limit the file size to be scanned (probably you don't want to scan your movie
# files ;))
# Value of 0 disables the limit. 1 Mb should be fine.
ClamukoMaxFileSize 1M

# Enable archive support. It uses the limits from clamd section.
# (This option doesn't depend on ScanArchive, you can have archive support
# in clamd disabled).
