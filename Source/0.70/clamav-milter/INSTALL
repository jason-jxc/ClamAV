BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

A makefile was supplied with this which should have built the program. If it
fails please let us know, and here are some hints for building on different
platforms.

Tested OK on Linux/x86 with gcc3.2.
	cc -O3 -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loops clamav-milter.c -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o

Compiles OK on Linux/x86 with tcc 0.9.16, but fails to link errors with 'atexit'
	tcc -g -b -lmilter -lpthread clamav-milter.c...

Fails to compile on Linux/x86 with icc6.0 (complains about stdio.h...)
	icc -O3 -tpp7 -xiMKW -ipo -parallel -i_dynamic -w2 clamav-milter.c...
Fails to build on Linux/x86 with icc7.1 with -ipo (fails on libclamav.a - keeps saying run ranlib). Otherwise it builds and runs OK.
	icc -O2 -tpp7 -xiMKW -parallel -i_dynamic -w2 -march=pentium4 -mcpu=pentium4 clamav-milter.c...

Tested with Electric Fence 2.2.2

Compiles OK on Linux/ppc (YDL2.3) with gcc2.95.4. Needs -lsmutil to link.
	cc -O3 -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loop -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o -lsmutil
I haven't tested it further on this platform yet.
YDL3.0 should compile out of the box

Sendmail on MacOS/X (10.1) is provided without a development package so this
can't be run "out of the box"

Solaris 8 doesn't have milter support so clamav-milter won't work unless you
rebuild sendmail from source.

FreeBSD4.7 use /usr/local/bin/gcc30. GCC3.0 is an optional extra on
FreeBSD. It comes with getopt.h which is handy. To link you need
-lgnugetopt
	gcc30 -O3 -DCONFDIR=\"/usr/local/etc\" -I. -I.. -I../clamd -I../libclamav -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loops clamav-milter.c -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o -lgnugetopt

FreeBSD4.8: compiles out of the box with either gcc2.95 or gcc3

OpenBSD3.4: the supplied sendmail does not come with Milter support.
Do this *before* running configure (thanks for Per-Olov Sjöhol
<peo_s@incedo.org> for these instructions).

	echo WANT_LIBMILTER=1 > /etc/mk.conf
	cd /usr/src/gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail
	make depend
	make
	make install
	kill -HUP `sed q /var/run/sendmail.pid`

Then do this to make the milter headers available to clamav...
(the libmilter.a file is already in the right place after the sendmail
recompiles above)

	cd /usr/include
	ln -s ../src/gnu/usr.sbin/sendmail/include/libmilter libmilter

Solaris 9 and FreeBSD5 have milter support in the supplied sendmail, but
doesn't include libmilter so you can't develop milter applications on it.
Go to sendmail.org, download the lastest sendmail, cd to libmilter and
"make install" there.

Needs -lresolv on Solaris

INSTALLATION

Install into /usr/local/sbin/clamav-milter.

See http://www.nmt.edu/~wcolburn/sendmail-8.12.5/libmilter/docs/sample.html

Installations for RedHat Linux and it's derivatives such as YellowDog:
	Ensure that you have the sendmail-devel RPM installed
	Add to /etc/mail/sendmail.mc:
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
	define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `clamav')

	Check entry in /usr/local/etc/clamav.conf of the form:
	LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.sock
	StreamSaveToDisk

	If you already have a filter (such as spamassassin-milter from
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/spamass-milt) add it thus:
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`spamassassin', `S=local:/var/run/spamass.sock, F=, T=C:15m;S:4m;R:4m;E:10m')
	define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `spamassassin,clamav')dnl

	mkdir /var/run/clamav
	chown clamav /var/run/clamav	(if you use User clamav in clamav.conf)
	chmod 700 /var/run/clamav

You may find INPUT_MAIL_FILTERS is not needed on your machine, however it
is recommended by the Sendmail documentation and I recommend going along
with that.

The above example shows clamav-milter, clamd and sendmail all on the
same machine, however using TCP they may reside on different machines,
indeed clamav-milter is capable of talking to multiple clamds for redundancy
and load balancing.

I suggest putting SpamAssassin first since you're more likely to get spam
than a virus/worm sent to you.

Add to /etc/sysconfig/clamav-milter
	CLAMAV_FLAGS="--max-children=2 local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock"
or if clamd is on a different machine
	CLAMAV_FLAGS="--max-children=2 --server=192.168.1.9 local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock"

If you want clamav-milter to listen on TCP for communication with sendmail,
for example if they are on different machines use inet:<port>.
On machine A (running sendmail) you would have in sendmail.mc:
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=inet:3311@machineb, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
On machine B (running clamav-milter) you would start up clamav-milter thus:
clamav-milter inet:3311

You should have received a script to put into /etc/init.d with this software.

You should always start clamd before clamav-milter.

As with all software it is wise to ensure that clamav-milter has the least
privileges it needs to run. So don't run it as root and don't store the sockets
in a directory that can be written by everyone. For example ensure that /var/run
is owned and writable only by root and add entries for 'User' and
'FixStaleSocket' in clamav.conf.

0.67i	27/2/04	Dropping priv message now same as clamd
		Only use TCPwrappers when using TCP/IP to establish

		determine if strerror_r exists
0.70	17/3/04	Up-issued to 0.70
0.70a	20/3/04	strerror_r is a bit confused on Fedora Linux. The
		man page says it returns an int, but the prototype
		in string.h says it returns a char *
		Say how many bytes can't be written to clamd - it may give a
		clue what's wrong
0.70b	26/3/04	Display errno information on write failure to clamd
		Ensure errno is passed to strerror
		Print fd in clamfi_send debug
0.70c	27/3/04	Timestamp clamfi_send messages

		config file location has changed
