Q: Does ClamAV repair infected files ?
A: No. Due to the structure of used database, it can't repair infected files.
   The database has no information about virus cleaning. However OLE2
   (mainly Microsoft Office files) cleaning will be implemented !

A: No, but it has some common features with ScannerDaemon, such as a similar
   pattern matching algorithm.
