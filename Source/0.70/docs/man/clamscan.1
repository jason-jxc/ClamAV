.TP 
\fB\-\-unzip[=FULLPATH]\fR
In most cases you don't need this option \- the built\-in unarchiver will do extract Zip archives. This option however may be used as a backup for internal unpacker \- see the full documentation for more information. When enabled without an argument, unzip program will be searched in $PATH. If unzip cannot be found in $PATH, you must force it with =pathname. Remember about '=' between the option and an argument.

clamscan uses unzip for .jar files, so optionally eventually you will need to pass a full path to unzip.
.TP 
\fB\-\-deb[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports debian binary packages. Implies \-\-tgz, but doesn't conflict with \-\-tgz=FULLPATH. It requires ar utility.

This option supports non\-compressed archives.
.TP 
\fB\-\-tgz[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports tar.gz and .tgz files. You need GNU tar, on non\-Linux system you probably have it installed as gtar. If it's in $PATH, please use \-\-tgz=gtar in other case please pass a full path.
